git clone [https://github.com/KlaiRayen/YOLOv8 Product Detection System.git](https://github.com/KlaiRayen/YOLOv8-Product-Detection-System.git)
cd YOLOv8-Product-Detection-System
```

### Step 2: Install required packages
Install the necessary Python packages using pip

### Step 3: Run the application
Start the application by running:
```bash
python main.py
```
Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible.

## Usage
